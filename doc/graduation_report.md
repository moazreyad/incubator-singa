# SINGA Graduation Check List Report

## Cheking SINGA Project Maturity Test

According to [tha Apache project maturity model](http://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html), there are some notes:

### IN10: The project is independent from any corporate or organizational influence. Independence can be understood as basing the project's decisions on the open discussions that happen on the project's main communications channel, with no hidden agendas.

Currently the SINGA project has contributions mainly from the National University of Singapore. The project must show more contributions from external developers. 

### CO60: The community operates based on consensus of its members (see CS10) who have decision power. Dictators, benevolent or not, are not welcome in Apache projects.

The external developersâ€™ contribution to SINGA may include participating openly in the decisions and making public voting for important issues such as design issues. 

### RE50: The release process is documented and repeatable to the extent that someone new to the project is able to independently generate the complete set of artifacts required for a release.

The process of preparing an Apache release of SINGA is not clearly documented.

### CO50: The way in which contributors can be granted more rights such as commit access or decision power is clearly documented and is the same for all contributors. 

The process of granting more rights based on contributions in SINGA is not clearly documented.

## Preparations

### Complete (and sign off) tasks documented in the status file

### Ensure suitable names for project name and product names

The project name is SINGA.

[tha Apache naming process](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/naming.html) is required during graduation. Some trademarks are registered in USA and China with this name.

(Required) The result of searching registered names in USPTO is one result named SINGA:

(Optional) The result of searching in China trademarks shows around 30 registered names with SINGA:

### Demonstrate ability to create Apache releases

This is demonstrated by the exisiting releases that was created, for example :

Apache SINGA v1.1.0  (12 February 2017)
https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/singa/1.1.0/

Apache SINGA v1.0.0  (8 September 2016)
https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/singa/1.0.0/

Apache SINGA v0.3.0  (20 April 2016)
https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/singa/0.3.0/

They are approved by the incubator project management committee (IPMC).

### Demonstrate community readiness

SINGA requires some [community building](https://incubator.apache.org/guides/community.html) effort.

Some suggestions:

1. Increase the number of independent committers. Guidelines requires that there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project.

2. Use the mailing list more.

3. Write articles and blogs on the project and its applications.

### Ensure Mentors and IPMC have no remaining issues

### Decide upon destination

The target destination for SINGA after graduation is: Top Level Project. 

### Prepare a resolution (top level candidates only).

SINGA can prepare a resolution after checking and improving the above items. 

    Incubator PMC (IPMC):

        For top level candidates, this is a recommendation VOTE

    Final hand-over
